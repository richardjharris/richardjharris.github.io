Title: 'た-form: not just for the past'
Featured: The た form actually has 9 different uses!
Category: Japanese

When studying Japanese you often hear た used in some strange ways! When
somebody finds something they are looking for, they don't say ある, they say
あった！ And have you ever been told ちょっと待った！ rather than
ちょっと待って！ ?

It turns out there are about 9 different uses for the ta-form. I was surprised.
How many do you know?

1. a past action or state (the most familiar use)

    // 母に手紙を書いた
    /// I wrote a letter to my mother.

2. repeated habitual actions in the past

    // あのころは、よく運動した
    /// I used to exercise a lot in those days.

3. a past event occurring under specific circumstances (!)

    // 帰るとすぐに手を洗った
    /// I would wash my hands immediately after I got home.

4. a past situation which has lasted until present time

    // 大きくなったね！
    /// You've grown, haven't you!

5. the discovery of a new state or situation

    // あ、そこにいたの！
    /// Oh, there you are!

6. recall of a future event

    // あ、あした試験があった！
    /// Oh, I have an exam tomorrow!

7. request for a listener's confirmation of a fact

    // あなたはどなたでしたか？
    /// Who are you?

8. advanced proclamation of the future realisation of an action or situation

    // よし、買った！ 
    /// Alright, I'll buy it!

9. a command (pretty rude) expressing urgency

    // やめた！やめた！ 
    /// Stop it!!

So don't be surprised if you see た used somewhere strange. After a while
living in Japan, I found myself saying あった！too!
