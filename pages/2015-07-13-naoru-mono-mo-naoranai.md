I came across this phrase in Tokyo Ghoul (東京[喰種]{グール}) which is apparently used a
lot by nurses/doctors when talking to patients:

> 入院中にお酒なんて、絶対　ダメなんです。  
> 治るものも治らなくなりますよ。

Drinking while in hospital is not allowed! You won't heal properly if you keep
doing that.

It's quite a strong phrase that literally means, "the things that are supposed
to heal properly, won't heal". 酒を飲まなきゃ治るものも、飲んでたら治らない.
Compared to the simple 治らないですよ, it's a stronger, more 説教 expression
and more likely to be used by angry or impatient people :)
