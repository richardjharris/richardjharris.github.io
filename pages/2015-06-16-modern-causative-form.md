title: The modern Japanese causative form ([使役形]{しえきけい})
slug: modern-japanese-causative-form
category: Japanese

I'm going to write about the _short_ causative and causative passive
forms, which are very common in spoken Japanese. They are also easier to
say! You've probably learned the regular form in a textbook:

<blockquote>牛にはビールを*飲ませる*と、肉が美味しくなるというのは本当ですか？
<cite>Is it true that if you *make* a cow drink beer, its meat gets more delicious?</cite></blockquote>

パパはお<ruby>留守番<rt>るすばん</rt></ruby>で、ごめんなさい。旅行に*行かせて*いただいてありがとうございます！
Sorry that you have to watch the house for me, dad. Thanks for *letting*
me go on the trip!

This produces a *ru-verb* which is then conjugated into passive to get the
*causative passive* form, where you are made to do something by someone
else:

惚れ薬を飲ませられたので、次に目の前に来た人を好きになるらしい… I was
made to drink a love potion, so apparently I'll fall in love with the
next person I cross eyes with...

Everything fine so far? Good. Because the truth is, there's a shorter
form of 飲ませられる in speech: *飲まされる*. How do we make it?

## Making the short causative form (使役形) ##

* *u-verbs:* Take the negative form of a verb and replace い with す:
 * 言う becomes 言わす (normal: 言わせる) "to let/make someone speak" 飲む
 * becomes 飲ます (normal: 飲ませる) "to let/make someone drink"
* *ru-verbs:* Replace る with さす
 * 食べる becomes 食べさす (normal: 食べさせる) "to let/make someone eat"
* する becomes さす
* くる becomes こさす

This produces a u-verb ending in す which can be conjugated normally.
Here's a fun example sentence from Twitter:

今日はさくらん家で晩ご飯食べさしてもろた "Today Sakura gave me (allowed
me to eat) dinner at her house!"

Here the す turns into して (te-form) and is paired with もろた
(もらった) to mean 'allowed to'. (さくらん家 means さくらの家)

「若者を戦場へ行かすな！」 "Don't send young people out to war!"

## Making the short causative-passive form (使役受け身) ##

Since 行かす and friends are regular u-verbs we can conjugate the
passive like any other verb: make the *negative form, drop -i*, and *add
-areru*. Thus 行かす becomes 行かされる.

誕生日お祝いは、帽子をかぶらされて、ビールを飲まされたけど、楽しかった。
At my birthday party, I was made to wear a hat and made to drink beer,
but it was fun.

彼は変な医者にふしぎな薬を飲まされた。 A weird doctor made him take a
strange medicine.

映画館で彼女に3時間も待たされた。 I was made to wait over 3 hours for my
girlfriend at the movie theater.

Note that the subject in the English and Japanese sentences are swapped.
The English has the doer of the evil deed as a subject, while Japanese
has the victim as the subject. While you can certainly rephrase the
sentence another way ('My girlfriend made me wait for over 3 hours', or
'彼女は私を3時間も待たせた'), the ones above are more natural in many
cases.

## ご注意 (caution!) ##

*THERE IS A CATCH!* If the conjugated verb contains ささ, then Japanese
people have (somehow) decided that this is weird and not allowed. This
means you can't use this form on u-verbs ending in す or any ru-verb.

1. u-verbs ending in す: 返す -> <s>返さされる</s> (X)  話す -> <s>話さされる</s> (X)
2. ru-verbs: 食べる -> 食べさす -> <s>食べさされる</s> (X)

Finally, you should know that is is *very slangy* and should not be used
in a professional setting or basically anywhere where you're using 敬語
(keigo). But with friends or on LINE, it's fine.

Now go out and have fun using it!!
