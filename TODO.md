### High priority

- Design needs tweaking (maybe drop foundation entirely) - in particular headings for unicode assumptions article.
- Consider even line height 2.0

## Other

- Update Werkzeug if needed (2.2.2)

- Lint and reformat code.

- consider a grunt/gulp based pipeline to minimise all assets
  before deployment.

- formatting of example sentences is bad (Grey, small)
- formatting of acronym tags should use tooltips and look like the others

- unit tests (e.g. tags listing disappeared at one point,
  I didn't catch it)

- front page: better date format

- Google Analytics

- run the blog through performance analysis once live
- better title
- testing of mdx_reibun.py not complete... needs improvement maybe

- infinite scrolling
- should die on duplicate slug.
