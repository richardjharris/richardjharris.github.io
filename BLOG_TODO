Keep flat files, I like history tracking. But needs a better way of managing
the posts.

 - run the blog through performance analysis once live
 - better title
 - about page
 - improvements to 'featured'
    - change featured to use a tag and remove header?
 - testing of mdx_reibun.py not complete... needs improvement maybe

 - furigana is screwed up
  - use stuff from Japanese stack exchange

Inspiration 2: https://codeascraft.com/ (Etsy blog)
  infinascroller, I like a lot.
  URL is /YYYY/MM/DD/q1-2016-site-performance-report(/#comments)


Inspiration: http://jvns.ca/ (flat page + favourites)
 - Favourite page is split by year
  Feb 10 in favourite, rust, talks
  RSS feed (seems to just be one)
  Flat list of date + article name
  julia uses ./source/_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
