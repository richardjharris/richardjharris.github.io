 - Update Werkzeug if needed.

 - Lint and reformat code.

 - Add all the static content from the original blog,
   and redirects for old articles.

 - furigana formatting (The big one. Just leave for now?)

 - consider a grunt/gulp based pipeline to minimise all assets
   before deployment.

 - the tooltips on e.g. http://localhost:8000/modern-japanese-causative-form/
   are not very easy to see.
   - make same as unicode ones
   - more distinguishing of tooltip and non-tooltip highlights 

 - formatting of example sentences is bad (Grey, small)
 - formatting of acronym tags should use tooltips and look like the others

 - unit tests (e.g. tags listing disappeared at one point,
   I didn't catch it)
 
 - front page: better date format

 - actually deploy it.
   - makefile or something -> github
   - Google Analytics

 - run the blog through performance analysis once live
 - better title
 - about page
 - improvements to 'featured'
    - change featured to use a tag and remove header?
 - testing of mdx_reibun.py not complete... needs improvement maybe

 - infinite scrolling
 - add date to slugs, just for safety. HOWEVER: date may change,
   and slugs can never change, how to deal with that?
   just bake the date into the slug anyway. or at least the year.
