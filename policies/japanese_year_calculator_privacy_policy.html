    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      The Japanese Year Calculator app ('the Application') was created by
      Richard Harris ('the Author') and is provided at no cost and is intended
      for use as-is. No personal information is knowingly collected by the
      Application and it makes no internet requests. The current version, as of
      writing, of the Android version of the Application has no permission to
      contact the internet and will not request that permission at any time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Application uses the Google Play Marketplace for distribution and
      updates. The Application Author is not responsible for information
      collected by Google in relation to usage of the Application; please
      consult the terms and conditions and Privacy Policy for Google Play
      Marketplace for more information.
    </p>
    <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
    <p>
      The Application contains links to other sites or e-mail addresses. If you
      click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. The Author
      is not responsible for, and has no control over, the content, privacy
      policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.
    </p>
    <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The Application does not knowingly collect personal information and as
      such does not collect personal information from children either. The
      Author encourages children to refrain from submitting personally
      identifiable information via the Application. The Author encourages
      parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and
      to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide
      personally identifiable information through the Application without their
      permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided
      personally identifiable information to us through the Application, please
      contact the Author. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent
      to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your
      country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so
      on your behalf).
    </p>
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Thus, you are
      advised to review this page periodically for any changes. The Author will
      notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
    </p>
    <p>This policy is effective as of 2022-02-06.</p>
